    <div> ---------------------------------------------- </div>
    <p id="story">&nbsp; half + half is an independently owned and operated ice creamery dedicated to providing high quality, delicious ice cream to all. All our ice cream is non-GMO and cruelty-free! Our dairy comes from independent family farms and all ingredients are loccaly sourced. We have four locations across the United States: LA, San Francisco, and New York City, with a brand new cafe-style storefront opening INSIDE the Adobe World Headquarters in San Jose!  </div>
    <p id="story">&nbsp; &nbsp; The story of half+half began when our founders, Christina and Cori, met at a farmer’s market in 2016 and instantly hit it off, deciding to combine their skills of ice-cream-flavor inventing and superior cow-herding (respectively). After a lot of tasting, testing, and experimentation, the phenomenally unique flavors like pancakes, mochi, guava, and hibiscus tea were created. And thus half+half was born, and we’ve been churning out even more delicious flavors ever since.</div>
